Week 10:

Minesweeper is complete! Although I didn't meet all my stretch goals, in the process of writing the game (as is ineveitable), I realized that some of my goals were actually rather difficult and required more time and thought than I was anticipating. For example, writing a timer to run in a seperately managed thread to allow continous gameplay but only on first click was rather challenging and required a lot of additional research and practice with multithreading and asynchronous operations. However, although the game isn't quite as customizable as I was hoping, I believe it's an extremely well-written, well-managed game, mimicking almost all the functionality in classic minesweeper. Graphics programming in C++ is never particularly easy, and I was really happy with how the game turned out looked.

Additionally, although I didn't necessarily have even bitbucket contributions week to week as a result of midterm schedules and project schedules in my other classes (notably, Physics 411 and Physics 413), I spent cumulatively around 40 hours on this project, so I would really appreciate some leniency on the week-to-week grading; the total amount of work was there, there were just some weeks I couldn't spend quite as much time on the project as I would've liked.

All-in-all, the game I've built is clean, fun to play, and was a pleasure to programming. At the end of the project, I felt like my skills with memory management improved dramatically, I investigated several concepts I only understood tangentially (graphics programming, dynamic libraries, multithreading, and asyncronous functions, to give a few examples), and the product is something I'm actually pretty proud of. I hope you enjoy it as well.
