Week 9:

Unfortunately, the snow days set me a bit behind in some of my other classes and I had extra homework in those courses to work on the last week to catch up, so I didn't have a chance to add much functionality. I spent several hours debugging and testing the program, however, and was able to identify a few bugs, one severe, and a few more subtle. With that said, I intend on investing a plenty of time this week into the graphics functionality, which is the last remaining aspect of the game to develop. After some research, I've decided to use OpenGL as my graphics and interactions library, and use copyright free sprites and basic shapes inherent to OpenGL. Once graphics implementation is done, I will use the remaining time to add some simple customizations to the game to improve playability.
